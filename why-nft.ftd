NFTs started out cool. And then people started perceiving them to be nothing 
more than overpriced jpegs. That's simply not true. They can be so much more! 
The way a jar could be filled with cookies, candies, pickled stuff or have 
coins in them, it is up to us what value an NFT should have in them. Think of 
NFTs to be a container that depending on what's inside them, can change 
the experience for the NFT owner. Let's get to know NFTs better.

The other side of the coin really! If something can store value, that value can
be extended to provide real-world utility. Imagine creating a bunch of extended
value-adds around the statement, “if a user has a particular NFT then, allow
them to...”

-- lib.ul-section:

- Access unique offline/online brand experiences.
- Try samples / buy exclusive items / vote & comment.
- Burn NFT for $ value on Ecom & DTC site.

-- lib.brand-objective: Brand Objective:

You can look up all the wallets that have a particular type of NFT across
blockchains. Thereby you can check valuable NFTs, valuable collections and high
value wallets. You can determine or percieve the value of wallets that own your
brand NFTs!

-- lib.ul-section:

- Use NFTs to track wallets & user behavior
- NFT Profiles based on NFTs owned / spends

-- lib.brand-objective: Brand Objective:

Determine spends capacity / Exclusive product upsell / Re-targetting.

NFTs allow for barter / swaps / upgrades / downgrades etc. You can also build
associations like “if user has NFT X, drop NFT Y in to their wallet. This makes
NFTs highly flexible as a tradeable asset.

-- lib.ul-section:

- Use NFTs to gamify interaction with users.
- Use Marketplaces to Swap / Trade/ Drop one for one NFT to drive engagement.
- NFT collab with partner brands to magnify value-add / build ecosystem.

NFTs can be built to allow composability. You can merge multiple composableNFTs
into one or break down an NFT into smaller components. Makes for interesting
evolutionary models to be built using NFTs.

-- lib.ul-section:

- Merge & evolve NFTs in collectibles / games.
- Pro rate ownership of assets
- Divesting partial assets for $ value

-- lib.brand-objective: Brand Objective:

Increased consumer base via co-ownership of high net worth goods. Engagement /
revenue via collectibles & P2E.
