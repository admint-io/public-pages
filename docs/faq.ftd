We have developed the `faq` and `question-accordion` component for
[admint.io/learn](https://admint.io/learn), which matches the design currently
displayed on the live site.

-- ds.h3: How to use?

To use the `faq` and `question-accordion` components you need to import
`lib.ftd` inside your `.ftd` file, as shown below:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: public-pages/lib

-- ds.markdown:

Once you import the `lib` inside your `.ftd` file, use the `faq` and
`question-accordion` component by adding all required attributes of it.

You can also use `question-accordion` component if you want to show a accordion
like UI on your `.ftd` pages. Just add `title` and `body` to it. Check second
`question-accordion` component in below code snippet.

\-- lib.question-accordion: What is Web 3.0?

Web 3.0 is the next level of the internet, just like how you will go to high
school after finishing grade school. The first version of the internet is like
Web 1.0, where people just put up websites for others to read. But as the
internet grew, more things were added like videos, social media, and online
shopping. This is like Web 2.0, it’s more interactive and fun, but still needs
people to tell it what to do.

Web 3.0 is like having a robot helper that can do things for you online, like
finding the best videos or helping you buy things. It’s still being developed,
but it will make the internet even more helpful and fun to use. And this is
where Blockchain comes in, it’s like a special notebook where you can write
things down that everyone can see and trust, so the computers can talk to each
other and make decisions without needing people to tell them what to do. So,
it’s like the internet is growing and getting smarter, just like how you are
growing and learning new things as you go through school or life, in general.
